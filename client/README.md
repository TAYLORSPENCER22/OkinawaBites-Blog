This is a project i've been working on in 2025; it is a personal diary of all the amazing foods and experiences i had while traveling through okinawa japan. It's started as an okinawa foodie blog, but i plan to use it as a personal food diary for all of my future foodie adventures. 

I used the MERN stack to create this app. -- still workin on styling
