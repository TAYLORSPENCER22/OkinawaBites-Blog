This is a project i started Jan 2025 during my trip to Okinawa Japan. It is a personal diary of all the amazing foods I had while traveling through the country.

It's currently an okinawa diary, but i plan to morph it into a personal food diary so i can remember all of the delicious meals i've had around the world.

I used the MERN stack to create this app -- css is still a work in progress.
