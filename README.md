This is a project i started Jan 2025 during my trip to Okinawa Japan. It will be a personal diary of all the amazing foods I had while traveling through the country.

It will start as an okinawa diary - but i plan to morph it into a personal food diary so i can remember all of the delicious meals i've had around the world.

I used the MERN stack to create this app -- currently working on css and responsive design .. 2/13/25
